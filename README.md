## rudimentary install guide

1) install python from python.org, preferably python 3.9 or above. if you are installing it then make sure to check the box to install pip when it asks you during the install process. also check the box to set up the `PATH` environment variable or whatever and restart your pc if necessary
2) make sure python works from the terminal by going into command prompt and typing `python` (if it doesn't work, try `python3`). if it doesn't work no matter what you try, try adding python to environment path (google how to do that)
3) close that terminal and open up a new terminal and install the dependencies by typing in `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`. if it doesn't work, you may have to try using `python` instead of `python3`
4) once you have that working, download the source code by clicking on the green `<> code V` button and clicking "download ZIP"
5) unzip the file from file explorer or whatever
6) navigate to the unzipped folder with the source code
7) i think double clicking on the "server.py" should run it. the server.py is always required in the background because it manages all the windows for the limbo key game
8) double click on "spawn-all.py". if it doesn't work, try changing `python3` to `python` in the source code in spawn-all.py

### need tech support?

if you are struggling to install this, make a github issue and someone who knows what they are doing may help you. this may or may not be me (probably not me, i don't have that much free time). if you know what you are doing and want to help others, then please answer people's questions in the github issues and i will try to mark them as resolved.
